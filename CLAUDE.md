## Project Overview

**Clearwater Deal Intelligence Engine** — A RAG-based AI automation system built on n8n for Austin Hollins (AE) at Clearwater Security & Compliance. The engine ingests deal communications (emails, call transcripts, PDFs, PowerPoints, CSVs) from a dedicated Gmail inbox into a Qdrant vector database, then orchestrates specialized AI agents to:

1. **Score every active deal** using the CPS/P2V2C2 methodology (22 tracked artifacts)
2. **Generate high-quality outputs** — follow-up emails, pre-call planners, branded Approach Document PDFs, executive PowerPoint presentations
3. **Answer deal questions** via an n8n chat widget (deal-scoped and cross-deal queries)
4. **Sync and prep for meetings** via Google Calendar integration (Phase 5+)

Clearwater sells cybersecurity, risk management, and compliance services to healthcare organizations. Primary user: Austin Hollins (~20-25 active deals at any time).

See [`.claude/PRD.md`](.claude/PRD.md) for full requirements across all 6 phases.

## Architecture

### Workflow Chain

```
Gmail Trigger (every 1 min)
  → Workflow 1 (CW-01): Deal Ingestion Pipeline
      → emails, transcripts, PDFs, PPTX, CSV
      → classify → dedupe → chunk → embed → Qdrant insert
      → POST /webhook/deal-health-trigger
          → Workflow 2 (CW-02): Deal Health Agent
              → 15 RAG queries (one per CPS dimension)
              → Claude Opus scores all 22 artifacts
              → Postgres: insert to deal_health table
              → POST /webhook/ad-tracker-trigger
                  → Workflow 5a (CW-05 AD Tracker): gap assessment + approach doc
              → Nightly rescore also runs at 9pm ET

Power Automate (Outlook calendar trigger)
  → POST /webhook/calendar-event-ingest
      → Workflow 5b (CW-05: Calendar Event Ingestion)
          → parse attendees → derive deal_id from external domain
          → Postgres: upsert deal + insert calendar_events
          → POST /webhook/deal-health-trigger → CW-02 (calendar_only zero-score if no other docs)
  NOTE: Calendar events do NOT go through Gmail or CW-01.
  To test synthetically: POST JSON directly to /webhook/calendar-event-ingest
  Required fields: subject, start, end, organizer, attendees (semicolon-separated emails),
                   eventId, location, bodyContent

n8n Chat Widget
  → Workflow 4 (CW-04): Q&A Chat Agent
      → POST /webhook/output-request
          → Workflow 3 (CW-03): Output Generation Agent
              → retrieve output history → RAG → Claude generates
              → Gmail send to Austin's Outlook
              → Postgres: log to outputs_log
```

### Qdrant Design
- **Collection:** `deals` — 1536 dimensions, Cosine distance, int8 quantization
- **Namespace per deal:** `deal_id` (e.g. `cw_acmehospital_2025`)
- All retrieval queries are namespace-scoped — no cross-deal contamination
- Payload schema per chunk: `deal_id`, `company_name`, `sender_domain`, `deal_stage`, `doc_type`, `date_created`, `chunk_index`, `attribution_confidence`

### Postgres Tables
| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `deals` | Master deal registry; maps deal slugs to Salesforce opp IDs |
| `ingestion_log` | Every processed email; deduplication by `message_id` |
| `deal_health` | Append-only P2V2C2 scores + all 22 artifacts per scoring run |
| `outputs_log` | Every AI-generated output per deal/contact — the output memory store |
| `attribution_queue` | Low-confidence emails awaiting Austin's confirmation |
| `calendar_events` | Phase 5: Google Calendar mirror linked to deals |
| `n8n_chat_histories` | Permanent agent conversation history (Postgres Chat Memory) |

---

## CPS Methodology (P2V2C2)

Clearwater's proprietary sales framework. The health agent scores 6 dimensions (0-5 each, 30 max total):

| Dimension | Score 0 | Score 5 |
|---|---|---|
| **Pain** | No knowledge of pain | ES agreed pain large enough to change |
| **Power** | No idea who is power | DAP steps on schedule |
| **Vision** | No idea of needs | ES painting vision to others in org |
| **Value** | Benefits unknown | DM agreed to financial terms |
| **Change** | No one committed | ES convinced DM they must change |
| **Control** | Buying process unknown | DAP complete |

**Additional tracked:** PE Sponsor Score (1-5), Critical Activity Stage (e.g. "3B: Document Approach"), DAP (14 milestones, 14-day gap rule flagged).

**5 Sales Stages:** Discover → Qualify → Prove → Negotiate → Close

**Key roles:** PC (Potential Champion), C (Champion), PES (Potential Executive Sponsor), ES (Executive Sponsor), DM (Ultimate Decision Maker), DAP (Dual Action Plan)

## Key Patterns

### Ingestion Deduplication
Gmail `message_id` is the deduplication key. Before processing any email, check `ingestion_log` for an existing record with that `message_id`. If found, skip entirely.

### Contextual Enrichment
Every chunk is prepended with a `[DEAL CONTEXT]` header before embedding:
```
[DEAL CONTEXT]
Deal: Acme Health (ID: cw_acmehospital_2025)
Document Type: call_transcript
Date: 2026-02-14
Source: john.smith@acmehospital.org
[END CONTEXT]

[chunk content...]
```
This dramatically improves RAG retrieval precision (Anthropic Contextual Retrieval pattern).

### Deal Attribution Confidence Routing
- **High/medium** → auto-assign to matching deal in `deals` table by sender domain or company name
- **Low** → insert to `attribution_queue`; surfaced to Austin via chat widget for confirmation

### New Deal Shell Opportunity (Calendar-Only)
When a calendar invite arrives from a domain not in the `deals` table, CW-01 automatically creates a new deal record at Discover stage. CW-02 then fires but detects (via `Postgres: Check Doc Types`) that the deal's only ingestion record is a `calendar_invite`. It takes the `IF: Calendar Only?` true branch and inserts a **zero-score placeholder** `deal_health` row (`trigger_type = 'calendar_only'`, `critical_activity_stage = '1A'`, `general_narrative = 'New deal created from calendar invite. No scoring data available yet.'`). This is **correct expected behavior** — not an error. The deal will score naturally as transcripts, emails, and other artifacts are ingested.

The placeholder skips the full RAG/Opus pipeline, stakeholder upsert, AD Tracker trigger, and declining alert — all correct for a shell deal with no substantive content.

### Append-Only Health History
The `deal_health` table **never updates** existing rows — always inserts a new row per scoring run. This preserves the full audit trail of P2V2C2 scores over time for trend analysis.

### Output Memory
Before generating any output, the agent queries `outputs_log` for all prior outputs to the same `recipient_email` for the same `deal_id`. This history is injected into the Claude prompt so every output builds on prior communications rather than repeating them.

### JSON Parsing Fallback
All Claude JSON responses are stripped of markdown code fences before parsing:
```js
const cleaned = raw.replace(/```json\n?/g, '').replace(/```\n?/g, '').trim();
const parsed = JSON.parse(cleaned);
```

POSTGRES_PASSWORD=          # Strong password
REDIS_PASSWORD=             # Redis auth

OPENAI_API_KEY=             # sk-... (for text-embedding-3-small)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=          # sk-ant-... (for Claude Sonnet + Opus)

GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=            # Ingestion inbox OAuth2 (Google Cloud Console)
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=
GMAIL_SEND_CLIENT_ID=       # Send outputs OAuth2
GMAIL_SEND_CLIENT_SECRET=
GMAIL_INGESTION_ADDRESS=    # Dedicated deal Intel Gmail address

GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID=  # Phase 5 — read-only calendar
GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET=

AUSTIN_EMAIL=               # Outlook address that receives all AI-generated outputs

GITHUB_TOKEN=               # PAT for GitHub MCP
GITHUB_REPO=                # username/repo for workflow version control
```

## MCP Setup (Claude Code ↔ n8n)

```bash
# After n8n is running, get your API key from n8n Settings → API
claude mcp add n8n-mcp \
  --env MCP_MODE=stdio \
  --env N8N_API_URL=http://localhost:5678 \
  --env N8N_API_KEY=<your-n8n-api-key> \
  --env DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true \
  -- npx -y n8n-mcp
```

Optionally install [n8n-skills](https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-skills) for better workflow generation quality.
